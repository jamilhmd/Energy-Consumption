# Energy Consumption Dashboard Project
## Overview
This Power BI project provides an in-depth analysis and visualization of energy consumption across various cities from January 2016 to December 2019. It focuses on understanding patterns in energy usage and costs associated with Electricity, Gas, and Water.

## Key Features
Total Cost Analysis: Insights into the total energy cost distribution by city, highlighting New York as the city with the highest total cost.
Consumption Type Breakdown: A detailed examination of energy consumption by type (Electricity, Gas, Water), offering a clear understanding of energy usage patterns.
Temporal Trends: Visualization of energy costs over time, aiding in the identification of trends and fluctuations in energy consumption and costs.
Comparative Building Analysis: Comparison of unit consumption by building, illustrating the variance in energy use across different infrastructure.

## Data Source
The project utilizes an "Energy Consumptions Dataset.xlsx," encompassing detailed records of energy usage, including the type of energy consumed, the total cost, and unit consumption metrics.

## Visualizations
A series of Power BI visualizations bring the data to life:

Stacked column charts for cost and consumption type over time
Pie charts for a graphical breakdown of consumption types
Detailed bar charts comparing energy usage among cities and buildings

## Insights and Conclusion
The dashboard reveals significant disparities in energy costs among cities, with New York bearing the highest energy expenses. It also uncovers the predominance of Water in the energy consumption mix, alongside seasonal and annual trends in energy usage.
